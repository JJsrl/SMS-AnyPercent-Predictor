## Data OverviewD

This project uses a dataset built from Super Mario Sunshine Individual Level (IL) times.  
Each row represents one runner, and each column represents the time they achieved in a specific level (Bianco 1, Ricco 2, Pianta 5, etc.).

**Target Variable:**  
`Personal Best` — the Any% full-game completion time (in seconds).

**Features Example:**  
- Bianco 1  
- Bianco 2  
- Gelato 7  
- Noki 1  
- Sirena 3  
- Pinna 5  
- Corona Mountain  

All times are converted from `MM:SS.xx` into seconds for modeling.

A more complete description will be added later.
